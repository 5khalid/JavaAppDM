<h1>Excel Data Parser and Visualization Tool for Project Management</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
this project involves developing a Java application that parses data from Excel files and stores the data of projects and their stages in objects. The application should be able to read three different files: Projects.xls, and two other files that are related to stages for each project. The application should merge the stage files together, linking the project information to the stages information by NodeID and ObjectValue.

Task 1: Initial Class Diagram: A class diagram needs to be created that represents the basic building blocks of the application. All fields and methods in every class need to be included with proper access modifiers (private, public, etc.). If the relation between two classes is an association, specify the multiplicity, label, and direction of the relationship.

Task 2: Develop the application: The application needs to present the parsed data in a proper GUI application. The application should list all projects in a list box on the left of the screen and draw a timeline representing the stages of the selected project and the duration from the first event to the last event. The design of the GUI is left up to the developers.
